Roses are purple.
Violets are orange
Violets are violet
Github is beautiful

But is it really
We need to talk about this
Because beauty is in the eye of the beholder
If Github is truly beautiful to us coders
I don't think it would be beautiful to birds

And so are you.


I need it write a poem
but i am not sure what to write
the blank computer screen
is not a brilliant sight

i have figured out what to do
i do not want stop now
coz i want a little crew
rather than to live in a shoe

if i see the queen i will cry
i am boared so i am going to sigh
