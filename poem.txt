Roses are purple.
Violets are orange
Violets are violet
Github is beautiful

And so are you.

But is it really
We need to talk about this
Because beauty is in the eye of the beholder
If Github is truly beautiful to us coders
I don't think it would be beautiful to birds

And so are you.


I need it write a poem
but i am not sure what to write
the blank computer screen
is not a brilliant sight



broccoli smells funny
and so do you
but i like you

there are different funny smells
good funny is the smell of gasoline
bad funny is the smell of a fine cheee shop
